# Bayesian Networks Project
A project that utilizes the PyAgrum library to create Bayesian Networks on data. The data provided gives the probability of SARS given an individual has, or has not, been on a flight recently, and whether the season is a high or low epidemic season. Finally, the data also outlines the probabilities of an individual having, or not having, a cough based on if they have SARS and also the probabilities of an individual having, or not having, a fever if they have SARS. Using such data, a Bayesian Network was created in order to make inferences on different scenarious regarding this data.

As an example, the probability of an individual having been on a Flight recently given that the individual currently has SARS, a Fever, and a Cough was evaluated using the created Bayesian Network (and it was found that the individual had a 42.93% chance of having been on a Flight recently given these conditions).
